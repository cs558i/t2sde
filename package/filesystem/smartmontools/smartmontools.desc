[I] Control and monitor storage systems using the S.M.A.R.T system

[T] The smartmontools package contains two utility programs (smartctl and
[T] smartd) to control and monitor storage systems using the Self-Monitoring,
[T] Analysis and Reporting Technology System (S.M.A.R.T.) built into most
[T] modern ATA and SCSI hard disks. It is derived from the smartsuite
[T] package, and includes support for ATA/ATAPI-5 disks. It should run on
[T] any modern Linux system.
