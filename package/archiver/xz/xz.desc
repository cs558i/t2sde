[I] XZ Utils

[T] A free general-purpose data compression software with high
[T] compression ratio. XZ Utils were written for POSIX-like systems
[T] (GNU/Linux, *BSDs, etc.), but also work on some not-so-POSIX systems
[T] like Windows. XZ Utils are the successor to LZMA Utils.
[T] 
[T] The core of the XZ Utils compression code is based on LZMA SDK, but it
[T] has been modified quite a lot to be suitable for XZ Utils. The primary
[T] compression algorithm is currently LZMA2, which is used inside the .xz
[T] container format. With typical files, XZ Utils create 30 % smaller
[T] output than gzip and 15 % smaller output than bzip2.
