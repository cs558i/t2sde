[I] ZIP file access library

[T] The zziplib library is intentionally lightweight, it offers the ability to
[T] easily extract data from files archived in a single zip file. Applications
[T] can bundle files into a single zip archive and access them. The
[T] implementation is based only on the (free) subset of compression with the
[T] zlib algorithm which is actually used by the zip/unzip tools.
