[I] Library for several streaming archive formats

[T] Libarchive is a programming library that can create and read several
[T] different streaming archive formats, including most popular tar variants,
[T] several cpio formats, and both BSD and GNU ar variants. It can also write
[T] shar archives and read ISO9660 CDROM images and ZIP archives. The bsdtar
[T] program is an implementation of tar(1) that is built on top of libarchive.
[T] It started as a test harness, but has grown into a feature-competitive
[T] replacement for GNU tar. The bsdcpio program is an implementation of
[T] cpio(1) that is built on top of libarchive
