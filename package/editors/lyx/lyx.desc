[I] An advanced LaTeX-based typesetting and text editing program

[T] LyX is an advanced document processor for Unix. It encourages an
[T] approach to writing based on the structure of your documents, not
[T] their appearance, allowing you to concentrate on writing rather
[T] than visual layout. It automates formatting according to predefined
[T] rule sets, yielding consistency throughout even the most complex
[T] documents.
