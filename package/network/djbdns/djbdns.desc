[I] A collection of Domain Name System tools

[T] djbdns is a collection of Domain Name System tools. It includes software
[T] for all the fundamental DNS operations:
[T]
[T] - DNS cache: finding addresses of Internet hosts. When a browser wants to
[T] contact www.hotwired.com, it first asks a DNS cache, such as djbdns's
[T] dnscache, to find the IP address of www.hotwired.com. Internet service
[T] providers run dnscache to find IP addresses requested by their customers.
[T] If you're running a home computer or a workstation, you can run your own
[T] dnscache to speed up your web browsing.
[T]
[T] - DNS server: publishing addresses of Internet hosts. The IP address of
[T] www.hotwired.com is published by HotWired's DNS servers. djbdns includes
[T] a general-purpose DNS server, tinydns; network administrators run tinydns
[T] to publish the IP addresses of their computers. djbdns also includes
[T] special-purpose servers for publishing DNS walls and RBLs.
[T]
[T] - DNS client: talking to a DNS cache. djbdns includes a DNS client C
[T] library and several command-line DNS client utilities. Programmers use
[T] these tools to send requests to DNS caches.
[T]
[T] djbdns also includes several DNS debugging tools, notably dnstrace, which
[T] administrators use to diagnose misconfigured remote servers
