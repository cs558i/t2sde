[I] A message bus system

[T] D-BUS is a message bus, used for sending messages between
[T] applications. Conceptually, it fits somewhere in between raw sockets
[T] and CORBA in terms of complexity.
[T]
[T] D-BUS supports broadcast messages, asynchronous messages (thus
[T] decreasing latency), authentication, and more. It is designed to be
[T] low-overhead; messages are sent using a binary protocol, not using
[T] XML. D-BUS also supports a method call mapping for its messages, but
[T] it is not required; this makes using the system quite simple.
