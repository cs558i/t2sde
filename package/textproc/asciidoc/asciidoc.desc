[I] Text based document generation

[T] AsciiDoc is a text document format for writing short documents,
[T] articles, books and UNIX man pages. AsciiDoc files can be translated
[T] to HTML and DocBook markups using the asciidoc(1) command.
[T] AsciiDoc is highly configurable: both the AsciiDoc source file syntax
[T] and the backend output markups (which can be almost any type of
[T] SGML/XML markup) can be customized and extended by the user.
