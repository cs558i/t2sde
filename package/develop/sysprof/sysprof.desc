[I] A sampling systemwide CPU profiler for Linux on x86

[T] Sysprof is a sampling CPU profiler that uses a Linux kernel module to
[T] profile the entire system, not just a single application. It handles
[T] shared libraries, and applications do not need to be recompiled. It
[T] profiles all running processes, not just a single application, has a
[T] nice graphical interface, shows the time spent in each branch of the
[T] call tree, can load and save profiles, and is easy to use.
