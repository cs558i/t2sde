[I] Typesafe Signal Framework for C++

[T] This library implements a full callback system for use in widget libraries,
[T] abstract interfaces, and general programming. Originally part of the Gtkmm
[T] widget set. Libsigc++ is now a seperate library to provide for more general
[T] use. It is the most complete library of its kind with the ablity to connect
[T] an abstract callback to a class method, function, or function object. It
[T] contains adaptor classes for connection of dissimilar callbacks and has an
[T] ease of use unmatched by other C++ callback libraries.
