Error=Using pip might break you system. Try emerging packages
 from T2 SDE's source repository or get it prebuild from
 our already released binaries.

 If you wish to install a Python package unavailable on T2 SDE,
 create a virtual environment (python -m venv) or use language
 specific package manager such as pipx that manages venvs
 automatically.

 If you really want to install a system-wide dependency with pip
 then you can pass the "--break-system-packages" flag which is
 really NOT RECOMMENDED.
